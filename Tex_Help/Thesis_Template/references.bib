% | The STRING command can be used to define abbreviations.  This is especially
% | useful in defining an abbreviation to represent journal titles (or
% | abbreviations).  In the first example below, "ARPC" is defined to represent
% | "Annu. Rev. Phy. Chem." (the standard abbreviation for the journal "Annual
% | Review of Physics and Chemistry.")  Any reference in your text to ARPC will
% | be replaced by the full string, Annu. Rev. Phy. Chem.  Abbreviations are not
% | case sensitive, i.e, "arpc" and "ARPC" are treated as the same.
% |
% | The STRING command must be preceded by the "at" symbol.
